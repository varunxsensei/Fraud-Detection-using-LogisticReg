# Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression for detecting fraudulent transactions in a dataset. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Project Structure

- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `app.py`: Python script to load the trained model and make predictions on new data.
- `fraud_detection_pipeline.pkl`: Serialized model pipeline for inference.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varunxsensei/Fraud-Detection-using-LogisticReg.git
   cd Fraud-Detection-using-LogisticReg
